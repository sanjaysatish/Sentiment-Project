 ## Sentiment Dictionary:
 The source for our sentiment dictionary comes from Notre Dame University's Software Repository for Accounting and Finance. Here there are multiple resources for textual analysis:
 
<https://sraf.nd.edu/textual-analysis/resources#All%20SEC%20EDGAR%20Filings%20by%20Type%20and%20Year>

We use an updated version of the dictionary created by Tim Loughran and Bill McDonald and described in their 2011 paper entitled "When is a Liability not a Liability?  Textual Analysis, Dictionaries, and 10-Ks" published in the *Journal of Finance*.

## Organization and Contents
### Data Folder
This folder houses all the data used for the project. it is split into two sections: "Sentiment Dictionary" which holds the dictionary and "Transcripts" which holds the transcripts we analyzed (both folders hold all accompanying scripts that were used to wrangle the data).
